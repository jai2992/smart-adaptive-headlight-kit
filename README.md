# Smart Adaptive Headlight Kit
![Uploading 1.jpgâ€¦]()

The Smart Adaptive Headlight Kit is a project aimed at converting normal headlights into smart adaptive headlights using a microcontroller and a PLDC film. This kit enhances road safety by reducing glare from headlights for oncoming drivers while ensuring optimal visibility for the driver.

## Features

- **Adaptive Lighting:** The headlights adjust their beam pattern based on the surrounding conditions, such as the presence of oncoming vehicles or ambient light levels.
- **Glare Reduction:** The PLDC film reduces glare for oncoming drivers, improving overall road safety.
- **Easy Installation:** The kit is designed for easy installation, requiring minimal modifications to the existing headlight system.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the Smart Adaptive Headlight Kit:

1. **Prepare the Headlight Housing:** Open the headlight housing and remove the existing headlight assembly.
2. **Install the Microcontroller:** Mount the microcontroller in a suitable location within the headlight housing.
3. **Attach the PLDC Film:** Apply the PLDC film to the inside of the headlight lens, ensuring it is securely attached and free of wrinkles.
4. **Connect Wiring:** Connect the wiring harness included in the kit to the microcontroller and the vehicle's electrical system.
5. **Test the System:** Test the adaptive lighting functionality to ensure proper operation.
